Instructions on how to run program:
The program consists of only one file GradesDriver.cpp. You must have g++
installed on your computer (I'm assuming any version of it will work, but I
used the newest one, being g++ 4.9.3).

1. Compile g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra GradesDriver.cpp
2. Run './a.out scores.txt' or './a.exe scores.txt' depending on machine.

I compiled this on windows Cygwin and it works perfect (./a.exe). But
there is a problem with ./a.out when it comes to outputing the mode.
The first few mode numbers are output but then there are erroneous
numbers (6.91848e-310).

Basic Statistic Calculations

The initial purpose for this project is to write functions that will
calculate the min, max, median, Q1, Q2, mean, mode, and standard deviation
using the midterm and final exam scores of 100 students.
